    Promises : Promises is an object representing the eventual completion( or faliure) 
                of an asynchronous operation and its resulting values

    There are three states of Promises
    1. Pending : The initial state. The operation hasnt finished yed
    2. Fulfilled(Resolved) : The operation completed successfully, and you have a result
    3. Rejected: The operation failed, usually returning an error message

    The upgraded version of promises : Async and Await
